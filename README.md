# Cinema-4D-Starter-Project
Cinema 4D is a computer animation, modelling, simulation, and rendering software. As an individual that loves to create and design, I thought it would a great challenge to learn Cinema 4D. With previous experience in video editing using Adobe Premiere Pro, Adobe Rush and other Adobe Creative Clouds products [(past videos)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCEpHFLz5LQ), I was able to quickly learn the abundance of features Cinema 4D has to offer. At first, learning the software was very intimidating and overwhelming, but after following the video tutorials offered by [Cineversity](https://www.cineversity.com/vidplaylist/getting_started_in_cinema_4d_r25/getting_started_in_cinema_4d_01_series_overview_r25), I was able to be introduced to the basic concepts of working in Cinema 4D.  

### My Progress so Far
Here is what I have completed so far.

### Navigating the Workspace
Starting out, the Cinema 4D application can be very overwhelming. With an abundance of tools and controls, it can be very hard to start; especially if youâ€™re not familiar with working in 3D space. Functionalities and features that are coloured blue generate original objects and data from scratch, features coloured purple distort existing geometry or data, and features coloured green generate objects and data based on previous objects and data.
